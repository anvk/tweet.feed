This is one of my first Backbone web-based applications for fetching tweets based on a user query.

This app is inspired by a live backbone collections explained here http://weblog.bocoup.com/backbone-live-collections/
and also inspired by work of addyosmani in his backbone-fundamentals repo https://github.com/anvk/backbone-fundamentals

The end product suppose to work on Android phones and ported using PhoneGap

Technology used: Backbone, (AMD)Require.JS, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Note: this is just assets/www folder for the Android application. Full PhoneGap application is not included in this repo.
