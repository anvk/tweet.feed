This app is inspired by a live backbone collections explained here http://weblog.bocoup.com/backbone-live-collections/
and also inspired by work of addyosmani in his backbone-fundamentals repo https://github.com/anvk/backbone-fundamentals

The end product suppose to work on Android phones and ported using PhoneGap
